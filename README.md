# VacuumFormingMachine

Weekend project: Design a simple vacuum forming machine that makes use of off the shelf lumber and heating element(s)

Finished product was surprisingly effective. I purchased .040" HIPS sheets in 24"x24" from a local plastics distributor. Forms very nicely with a 2-3 minute heating time. 

Vaccum box is assembled using wood glue and 3" deck screws. Aluminum extrusions are from McMasterCarr.
